# Memory Game

### Overview

Using React, this project required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. It's made by following up the instruction below: 

1. Create a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

2. The application will behin by rendering different images to the screen. Each image will be in charge of listening for click events.

3. The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will then increment when an image is clicked for the first time. The user's score will then be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
