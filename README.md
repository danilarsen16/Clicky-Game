# Clicky-Game

## Overview

This is a memory game using React. The application's UI is split into four components.

## Instructions

1. Create a new React application using Create React App.

2. The app should render 12 different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

3. This app keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is then incremented when an image is clicked for the first time.  
The user's score will be reset to 0 if user clicks the same image more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will then restart.
